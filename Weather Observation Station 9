# MySQL:

SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
FROM STATION 
WHERE CITY NOT IN (
                   SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
                   FROM STATION 
                   WHERE CITY REGEXP "^[a,e,i,o,u]" );      # Here we are filtering the solutions of cities starting with vowels with 'NOT IN' Key word



Other WAY:

SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION
WHERE CITY REGEXP '^[^aeiou]';           #Here we can observe that the symbol'^' is inside the list as well as outside which gives results starting with except wovels
